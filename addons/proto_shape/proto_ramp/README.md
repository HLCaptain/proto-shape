# ProtoRamp

ProtoRamp is a dynamic ramp/staircase shape based on Godot's Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). It is designed to be used for prototyping levels and game mechanics.

## Usage

### Create a ProtoRamp

When adding a new child node, search for `ProtoRamp` and add it to the scene.

### Use Gizmos

ProtoRamp supports custom gizmos to adjust the shape.

### Change step counts in multiple ways

There are two ways of changing the step count:

- Fitting into `Staircase` dimensions: current width-height-depth of the staircase is respected, step dimensions will adjust.
- Using `Step` dimensions as a base: step dimensions are constant, staircase will shrink or grow to fit the steps.

You can also use both!
