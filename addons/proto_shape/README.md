## Gizmos

The gizmo for `ProtoRamp` supports setting 3 properties:

- Width
- Height
- Depth

It utilizes `ProtoGizmoUtils` for advanced 3D math calculations and plane projections to get the desired handle drag offset and set the properties accordingly.

### [ProtoGizmoWrapper](proto_gizmo_wrapper/README.md)

`ProtoGizmoWrapper` is an advanced wrapper for creating gizmo functionality for custom 3D nodes. It exposes 2 signals to implement custom gizmos for your nodes to *redraw* and *update* the properties of your node.

The gizmo is an `EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin` and is visible when the `ProtoRamp` node or a children of `ProtoGizmoWrapper` is selected. Selection hightlights the mesh with a transparent blue color and shows handles, which you can drag to adjust the shape.
