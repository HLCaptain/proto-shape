# ProtoShape - Godot Prototyping Extension for CSG

ProtoShape is a Godot plugin that adds a library of dynamic shapes based on Godot's Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). It is designed to be used for prototyping levels and game mechanics. It is not recommended to use this plugin for final levels as it is not optimized for performance.

## Contributing

The library is written in `GDScript` and (mostly) follows the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). Also static typing is used where possible.

Extend the library of shapes by creating an issue or pull request! Share your idea for a shape or feature you would like to see added to the library.
