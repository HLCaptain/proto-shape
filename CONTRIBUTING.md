## Conventions

To keep the code clean and readable, we are using coding conventions and rules. Make sure to follow them where possible.

The library is written in GDScript and (mostly) follows the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). Also use static typing where possible.

## Documentation

Document your code with comments where necessary, follow coding convention rules.

### Feature Documentation

For each larger feature, like a new and complex shape, make sure to write a proper, but not too extensive documentation using `Markdown`. It should be understandable for someone who is not familiar with the project.

Try to use the template from [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and place it in the proper folder.

If you see a document referencing related features or issues, make sure to **link them**. Like make a change in the main `README.md` to list new shapes you added.

### Diagrams, Sketches and Assets

Including diagrams/sketches and assets is not necessary, but can be helpful to understand the feature.

For new shapes or issues, a video/tutorial of how to use the shape can be very helpful and intuitive. You can record the issue or a prototype of your feature and include it in the documentation, saved in the locally created `assets` folder.

If you want to include diagrams or sketches, you can use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and export them as `SVG` files to the locally created `assets` folder. You can save the `.excalidraw` files in the `assets` folder to modify later if needed. You can also use other tools.
